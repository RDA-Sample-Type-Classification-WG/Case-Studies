Marine sediment core samples

## Characterising properties

Ship ID, ICES Code, Cruise ID, Sample number, Collection date,
Lat. Long., Water depth, Sampling device, sampling device code, core
length, P.I., Sample sections, core diameter.

Core samples are unique as they contain different types of sediment
collected from the seafloor. They are usually linked to other samples
via a cruise report. The core can be collected by a variety of
different sampling techniques and devices. Meaning they come in
several lengths, diameters and types of plastic liner. The liner can
initially be very long depending on recovery but it is cut into
several core sections on the ship that are standard tenths of 1 or
1.5m. The cores and then be split into two haves, an archive and
working half. This is before subsamples will be taken on the working
half only.
