# Samples in the magnetism and (many-body) quantum phenomena community

## About the magnetism and (many-body) quantum phenomena community

I am part of the magnetism and (many-body) quantum phenomena
community, investigating magnetic structures, their dynamics and
possibly more exotic states in a variety solid state material using
lab-based characterization methods and large scale facility
instruments e.g. neutron scattering.

## Samples in the magnetism and (many-body) quantum phenomena community

Samples are typically synthesized single cystals or powders.  Of
interest is a wide variety of materials, such as:

  * elemental metals and alloys
  * oxide ceramics
  * metal-organic perovskites

## Characterising properties

Properties of the samples that make them distinguishable from each
other (within the commuinty):

  * The nature of their magnetic ground state
  * Magnetic phase diagram in temperature, mag. field, el. field,
    pressure, etc.
  * Atomic compisition
  * Crystallographic symmetries
  * powder vs. single crystal

Properties allowing for distinction to samples of other communities:
An answer to the second question relies heavily on what exactly "other
communities" means.  It cannot be answered reasonably without
additional information.
