# Samples in the material science community

## About the material science community

Materials Science community (NFDI-MatWerk, and Helmholtz JL-MDMC
"Model and Data-driven Materials Characterization"), nanoscience
community (NFFA-Europe, "Nanoscience Foundries and Fine analysis")

## Samples in the material science community

Physical samples prepared and used for various experimental
measurements (e.g., SEM, TEM, STM, MRI, NMR, various metrology, stress
tests, ...).

PLEASE NOTE: I don't deal with any sample in a proper sense, as I
cover the data management part.  Thus, I'm in contact with the
scientific community but not directly involved (nor I have influence)
in the sample handling procedures established in the labs.

## Characterising properties

Many, see the current metadata schema (development still ongoing):
https://metarepo.nffa.eu/api/v1/schemas/general_sample 

## Vocabularies and metadata standards

The vocabularies or metadata standards being used in the community to
describe the samples can be found at the following links:

  * PRIMA Thesaurus for the mid-level provenance:
    https://purls.helmholtz-metadaten.de/skosmos/prima/
  * Sample Description Vocabulary (development still ongoing):
    https://purls.helmholtz-metadaten.de/skosmos/sdv/
  * EMGlossary: https://emglossary.helmholtz-metadaten.de
