# Samples in the polar scientific community

## About the polar scientific community

The polar scientific community deals with environmental data and
samples collected in polar (Arctic and Antarctic) and cryospheric
regions.  These include data from the Earth space to the ocean bottom
(space weather, meteorology, geophysics and terrestrial and marine
biology).

## Samples in the polar community

We hold information on physical samples covering polar sediments
(marine, peat and lake cores), geological specimens (land, dredge and
fossils), ice cores, herbarium specimens and biological samples
(marine pelagic and benthic, mammals, birds).

## Characterising properties

We hold environmental samples characterised by:

  * Discovery metadata from ISGN DataCite (https://support.datacite.org/docs/igsn-id-metadata-recommendations) 
  * Type (e.g. live, culture/isolate, fixed/preserved, dried, substrate, whole animal, tissue, see also https://www.geosamples.org/vocabularies/sample-type-object)
  * Dimensions (e.g. size, volume, weight)
  * Granularity (e.g. core, section, split, sub-sample)
  * Treatment (e.g. chlorophorm, ethanol, formaldehyde, lugol’s iodine, see also https://vocab.nerc.ac.uk/collection/S03/current/accepted/)
  * Provenance (e.g. locality, gazetteer, geolocation, date, depth, collection device, see also https://vocab.nerc.ac.uk/collection/S21/current/accepted/)
  * Storage (e.g. conditions, container type etc.)
  * Content (e.g. taxon, individual count, developmental state, sex, rock type)
  * Identifiers (e.g. sample unique ID, related samples ID, collector ORCID, institution ROR)

## Vocabularies and metadata standards

The vocabularies or metadata standards being used in the community to
describe the samples can be found at the following links:

## Sample PIDs being used

We use the following PIDs in the sample metadata:

  * ROR
  * ORCID

We are preparing a workflow to mint IGSN identifiers to samples
registered in our various sample databases.
